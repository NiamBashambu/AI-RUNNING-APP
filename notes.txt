App solution: Personalized training plans based on historical data.

Use strava API to access user data

Data colletion and preprocessing

Build AI Algorithms

    Data Analysis/Pattern Recognition:
        - Use historical performance data to analyze trends (improving pace, increasing distance).
        - Identify factors that lead to improvement, fatigue, or injury risk (e.g., heart rate changes).
    Machine Learning Models:
        - Supervised Learning: Train models that predict performance based on factors like cadence, stride length, heart rate, and more.
        - Time-Series Forecasting: Predict future performance based on past data.
        - Anomaly Detection: Detect abnormal performance (e.g., overtraining or undertraining) and suggest modifications.
        - Reinforcement Learning (optional): Personalize training plans by dynamically adjusting based on user performance.


design these training plans using AI models

backend and cloud services
    AWS cloud services
    MongoDB for data storage
    
thats it so far



- link the python file to the js
- create  front end in swift and link to js
 - learn swift
 - after all this: update pythom models to be more advanced
